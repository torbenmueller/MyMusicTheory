		<p>My name is <b><a href="https://www.torben-jan-mueller.com/" target="_blank">Torben Jan M端ller</a></b>, I am a freelance film composer. I studied at the Akademie Deutsche Pop
			in
			Cologne and graduated as a <b>film
				composer</b>, <b>composer</b>, <b>arranger</b> and <b>artistic producer</b>.
		</p>
		<p>I have read many books about harmony and composition and have studied music theory intensively. What was
			always missing for me was a complete work where you can learn and look up everything that is important for
			musicians.
			You need a lot of different learning

		<p>sources and have to laboriously put everything together yourself. In addition, much of the content is too
			theoretical and has no connection to practice.</p>
		<p>On the other hand, important topics such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentence_(music)" target="_blank">Sentence Form</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Period_(music)" target="_blank">Period Form</a> are not even mentioned. On
			this website I will gradually provide all the important topics that are relevant <b>for composers</b>.</p>
		<p>The focus is on the benefits for writing music. Why do I need certain techniques and how do I use them? It
			covers basics, such as a checklist for composing a melody, as well as special topics such as modal
			interchange, practically
			applicable harmony, various composition techniques and much more.</p>
