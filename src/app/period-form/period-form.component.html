<p>
	Start with a 2 bar basic idea, usually pretty harmonically stable (stay on the tonic). There is a sense of staying home.
	The basic idea is your main motive, it is the main identifying piece of your theme. The basic idea holds the main motives
	and interesting material that you're gonna use in the rest of your piece.
</p>
<p>
	You respond to it with a 2 bar contrasting idea.This is usually new material or variation on the basic idea.
	It feels like we're going somewhere, we're moving forward from that beginning. It feels like a question. By the end of the phrase
	we should feel like we're unresolved, that there is still more to come, that we want more and that the theme isn't finished yet.
	This whole first phrase, the question, is called the antecedent and then it gets responded to and answered by the consequent.
</p>
<p>
	At the beginning of the consequent (bar 5 and 6) you return to your basic idea. You can vary it, you can change it, but really
	at least the beginning of the basic idea should be the same. So it should be pretty clear we're back to where we were in bar 1.
</p>
<p>
	And then finally in bar 7 and 8 we have the cadence. It could be a perfect or a half cadence, but it should feel like a pretty
	strong sense of punctuation. It's a good idea for your cadence to be the opposite of whatever happended in your contrasing idea
	(e.g. if your contrasting idea ended on the V chord, you probably want to end your whole theme on the I chord).
